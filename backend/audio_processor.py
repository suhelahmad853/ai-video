00:00:04.799 a data structures and algorithms problem
00:00:06.480 so I need to study this and make sure
00:00:07.640 I'm prepared okay I know everyone says
00:00:09.040 the setting need code so I'm going to
00:00:10.120 pick a random problem and see what I can
00:00:11.559 do let's try this one number of Island
00:00:13.480 it's a medium medium doesn't seem too
00:00:15.160 bad I'm sure I can do it okay oh no the
00:00:17.199 brute force is not working all right I'm
00:00:19.000 probably just going to look up a
00:00:19.800 solution and see what I can do there
00:00:21.680 okay at least I beat 85% of people if
00:00:23.880 you're being completely honest with
00:00:25.080 yourself this is probably you everyone
00:00:27.320 says that LE code is super important for
00:00:28.960 coding interviews everyone tells you to
00:00:30.679 study n code you've read books like
00:00:32.279 cracking the coding interview you're
00:00:33.840 considering getting services like NE
00:00:35.559 code Pro algo expert Le code premium but
00:00:38.040 nothing is working no offense bro but
00:00:39.600 you probably can't solve Le Cod mediums
00:00:41.079 without looking up the solution deep
00:00:42.520 down in your soul you know you're but
00:00:44.840 you don't know what to do in this video
00:00:46.239 I'm going to teach you how I master data
00:00:48.160 structures and algorithms in just 8
00:00:49.960 weeks without any online course no
00:00:52.280 tutors and no prior knowledge experience
00:00:54.640 of data structures and algorithms
00:00:56.239 nothing whatsoever you're going to learn
00:00:57.840 how I went from not being able to solve
00:01:00.039 to some the easiest problem on Le
00:01:02.120 code.com all the way to being able to
00:01:03.920 solve 90% of leag code mediums and
00:01:06.400 several hards as well and how I use a
00:01:08.320 secret formula to land internships at
00:01:10.240 Amazon Shopify HP and a full-time sixf
00:01:13.560 figure software engineering job at age
00:01:15.159 21 so you can do the same and land the
00:01:16.799 job of your dreams trust me if you
00:01:18.320 follow the advice in this video your
00:01:19.799 programming life will change forever
00:01:21.720 data structures and algorithms will no
00:01:23.280 longer feel impossible and you'll
00:01:24.960 finally be able to smash show coding
00:01:26.640 interviews in no time at all the first
00:01:28.400 thing I did to master data structures
00:01:29.960 and algorithms is that I sto trying to
00:01:31.600 learn data structures and algorithms
00:01:33.759 what the hell are you talking about why
00:01:35.159 would you stop trying to learn data
00:01:36.320 structures and algorithms before I
00:01:37.680 explain what the hell I'm talking about
00:01:39.079 we need to Define data structures and
00:01:40.759 algorithms just we're all on the same
00:01:42.200 page a simple way to define data
00:01:43.840 structures and algorithms or DSA is to
00:01:45.799 think about organizing a closet data
00:01:47.600 structures are like the different
00:01:48.799 storage methods you might use a hanger
00:01:50.759 for clothes a drawer for socks and
00:01:52.119 accessories and algorithms are the
00:01:54.119 specific steps you take to find the
00:01:55.880 clothing item you need if you need your
00:01:57.560 favorite shirt quickly you probably scan
00:01:59.560 the ERS only rather than looking through
00:02:01.479 every single item in the closet in
00:02:03.000 coding DSA helps organize and solve
00:02:05.320 problems efficiently just like
00:02:06.920 organizing and finding things in a
00:02:08.280 closet now let me explain why you need
00:02:09.878 to stop trying to learn data structures
00:02:11.640 and algorithms most people waste their
00:02:13.599 time reading textbooks watching online
00:02:15.879 courses watching NE code videos and
00:02:17.959 that's the reason why so many people
00:02:19.360 struggle with data structures and
00:02:20.480 algorithms it's because you're doing
00:02:22.000 something called The cookbook trap let
00:02:23.680 me explain when someone first steps into
00:02:25.560 a kitchen and tries to learn how to cook
00:02:27.360 very often people think okay the first
00:02:29.080 step is that I need to memorize hundreds
00:02:30.680 of recipes from a cookbook see you think
00:02:32.400 you'll be fully prepared when the time
00:02:34.040 comes but true skill only comes when you
00:02:35.959 crack some eggs burn a few pants and
00:02:37.959 adjust the heat as you go the best cooks
00:02:39.800 learn by doing and then only consult
00:02:41.879 recipes when absolutely necessary do you
00:02:43.879 see what I mean you're flipping the
00:02:45.080 order instead of watching YouTube
00:02:46.480 tutorials reading a textbook watching
00:02:48.440 online courses you should just try a
00:02:50.480 data structures and algorithms problem
00:02:52.040 and then only learn the algorithm or
00:02:53.959 data structure after you fail trying to
00:02:55.720 solve it our brain only learns through
00:02:57.599 challenge see you spend all of your time
00:02:59.159 watching Instagram reals YouTube shorts
00:03:01.360 about coding instead of actually coding
00:03:03.120 because it's easy and that's why you're
00:03:04.480 stuck because you're watching videos of
00:03:06.120 solutions without actually challenging
00:03:08.159 yourself with real problems so stop
00:03:10.200 trying to learn data structures and
00:03:11.720 algorithms and instead start by
00:03:13.360 practicing tons and tons of DSA problems
00:03:15.840 and only consult lectures online courses
00:03:18.000 textbooks after you can't solve
00:03:19.519 something now that you realize that the
00:03:20.959 first step to learning data structures
00:03:22.560 and algorithms is to stop learning and
00:03:24.239 instead challenge yourself through
00:03:25.360 practice what do you actually practice
00:03:27.280 this answer is going to surprise you
00:03:28.720 because the second step to mastering
00:03:30.239 data structures and algorithms is to
00:03:32.000 stop following the N code road map but
00:03:33.920 it's not what you think but first who is
00:03:35.560 n code well n code is this YouTuber an
00:03:37.959 ex Google software engineer he created
00:03:40.040 this ultimate list called the N code 150
00:03:42.319 which is 75 problems on top of the blind
00:03:45.040 75 I know a lot of lists the blind 75 is
00:03:48.280 a list of the 75 most important coding
00:03:50.879 problems made by a meta software
00:03:52.360 engineer and to get this out of the way
00:03:53.959 n code is amazing his resources are
00:03:56.120 unparalleled and if you follow what I
00:03:57.599 said in the first point to practice and
00:03:59.840 only look at materials afterwards his
00:04:01.720 materials are some of the best out there
00:04:03.159 he's not a service to the World by
00:04:04.480 providing all these free Solutions
00:04:05.760 online and I genuinely love the guy so
00:04:07.799 what's the problem if n code is so great
00:04:09.760 why am I telling you to stop following
00:04:11.439 the N code road map it's simple ain't
00:04:13.400 nobody got time for that if you want to
00:04:14.640 get great at data structures and
00:04:15.959 algorithms in 2 months you don't have
00:04:17.918 time to go through the entire n code
00:04:19.680 road map it's simply not possible nor is
00:04:22.240 it efficient here are the problems with
00:04:23.800 the N code road map first of all it's
00:04:25.759 comprehensive which sounds like a good
00:04:27.400 thing but it's really not because it
00:04:28.639 covers tons of topics that you don't
00:04:30.360 actually need to know sure it's good to
00:04:32.039 know dynamic programming tries Math
00:04:34.840 logic problems but if you're going for
00:04:36.360 internships or newr roles it's just not
00:04:38.160 necessary it's also overly long 150
00:04:40.600 problems is great but very few people
00:04:42.440 can solve 150 difficult leak code
00:04:45.240 problems and learn from all of them in
00:04:46.639 Just 2 months it also has hard level
00:04:48.639 problems which also aren't relevant if
00:04:50.120 you're new to leak code again the neod
00:04:51.880 150 is a good overall resource but it's
00:04:54.160 simply not necessary if your goal is to
00:04:56.320 master data structures and algorithms in
00:04:57.919 2 months for internships or new Gra
00:04:59.720 roles so what's the secret well the
00:05:01.600 secret is to do the Paro problem set
00:05:03.479 instead so what is the parito problem
00:05:05.120 set well it's my problem set and it's
00:05:07.800 the 50 most high return on investment
00:05:10.240 problems from the neod 150 so why is it
00:05:12.759 so special it's simple it's designed to
00:05:14.400 be done in an 8we time period so if you
00:05:16.759 do these 50 problems over 8 weeks you
00:05:19.199 will be completely ready to tackle any
00:05:21.440 internship or new grad rooll coding
00:05:23.440 interviews now why is it better than the
00:05:25.120 blind 75 because 75 problems is pretty
00:05:27.759 close to 50 again because the blind 975
00:05:30.400 is for mid-level and Senior Engineers as
00:05:32.400 well people who are going for
00:05:33.600 entry-level roles simply don't need that
00:05:35.440 level of difficulty the Paro problem set
00:05:37.759 also only has problems that actually
00:05:39.639 show up in the interviews and doesn't
00:05:41.240 cover topics that are simply unnecessary
00:05:43.199 it also doesn't have any Le code hards
00:05:44.880 because you don't need them at this
00:05:45.840 point it's also in a better order as
00:05:47.600 well that helps understanding and gives
00:05:49.520 you topics that build upon each other if
00:05:51.319 you want the Paro problem set you can go
00:05:52.960 to AMOM manazer docomo to get it
00:05:55.960 absolutely for free and if you follow it
00:05:57.600 over 8 weeks you'll Master data
00:05:58.919 structures and algorithm in no time at
00:06:00.600 all however if you're making the next
00:06:02.199 mistake I see almost every single person
00:06:04.199 make no problem set is going to save you
00:06:06.479 not neat code not the predo problem set
00:06:08.880 nothing I've worked so far will work
00:06:11.000 unless you stop doing this I've seen so
00:06:13.560 many people Crash and Burn because they
00:06:15.400 make this one simple mistake see up till
00:06:18.039 now you've probably been doing this you
00:06:19.800 sit down a couple days a week you'll
00:06:21.160 pick a random leak code problem and try
00:06:23.199 it and after 30 to 40 minutes you either
00:06:25.000 solve it or you give up and then rinse
00:06:26.639 and repeat a few days later what's wrong
00:06:28.400 with this approach after all you're
00:06:29.720 following the first principle and
00:06:31.000 leading with practice rather than trying
00:06:32.599 to read through materials and lectures
00:06:34.080 online it's simple no one actually does
00:06:36.560 it consistently I've worked with
00:06:38.440 hundreds of computer science students
00:06:40.400 and if you can naturally sit down by
00:06:42.199 yourself for months at a time and
00:06:44.120 consistently study 5 to 10 hours a week
00:06:45.880 of Le code on your own God bless you
00:06:47.800 more power to you you're probably not
00:06:49.080 watching this video because you're
00:06:50.039 already a master of data structures and
00:06:51.440 algorithms see Le code is like going to
00:06:53.479 the gym for computer science Majors if
00:06:55.160 you go to the gym three to four times a
00:06:56.759 week work out with good consistent form
00:06:58.960 for months you will get jacked it will
00:07:01.240 happen guaranteed but the problem is
00:07:02.919 that very few people have the internal
00:07:04.720 discipline and motivation to stay
00:07:06.039 consistent with it which is why people
00:07:07.599 have personal trainers exercise classes
00:07:09.680 workout and groups because it makes that
00:07:11.240 consistency and accountability way way
00:07:13.199 easier that's a secret stop trying to do
00:07:15.280 leode alone in your bedroom and instead
00:07:17.199 create a system that actually enforces
00:07:19.039 that you get it done before I tell you
00:07:20.720 the two things you need to know to
00:07:22.639 create an accountability system for lead
00:07:24.400 code that actually works let me tell you
00:07:25.879 my story remember how I said I got good
00:07:27.479 in 8 weeks well that's the truth but but
00:07:29.599 it's not the whole truth in reality I
00:07:31.400 had actually been trying for two full
00:07:33.479 years before that 8we period but I
00:07:35.680 simply made zero progress in 1 to two
00:07:38.120 years I couldn't do anything I still
00:07:39.879 couldn't solve leak code easys I know
00:07:41.919 depressing I felt like I was doing
00:07:43.440 everything wrong in reality I only got
00:07:45.680 good at Le code during that 8we period
00:07:47.919 due to external accountability and
00:07:49.800 that's the thing everybody knows that LE
00:07:51.720 code is ultra important you've heard so
00:07:53.639 many times from me from other people
00:07:55.319 your friends your family your parents
00:07:56.720 that you have to do Le code but very few
00:07:59.080 people do it because they don't invest
00:08:00.599 in accountability and consistency now
00:08:02.520 there are two ways that I used external
00:08:04.560 accountability to master data structures
00:08:06.520 and algorithms and change my life in
00:08:08.240 just 8 weeks and the second one is going
00:08:10.360 to change everything for you the first
00:08:12.360 is through my algorithms class I know
00:08:14.199 how obvious come on you just took
00:08:15.639 algorithms isn't that so blatantly
00:08:17.400 obvious but it's not the way that you
00:08:19.120 think see my algorithms class at
00:08:20.840 University went into tons of algorithms
00:08:22.800 I simply didn't need to know and also we
00:08:24.680 did a lot of proofs in mathematics
00:08:26.400 simply were not necessary but the main
00:08:28.840 benefit is that I rigorously learned the
00:08:30.840 foundation of data structures and
00:08:32.320 algorithms so that I was able to apply
00:08:34.440 them to lead code problems far more
00:08:36.159 easily see you can look this stuff up
00:08:38.159 online at any time period all the data
00:08:40.240 structures and algorithms knowledge is
00:08:41.679 online completely for free 24/7
00:08:44.039 available for anybody who's interested
00:08:45.800 but a two-month college class that
00:08:47.880 forces you to rigorously go through all
00:08:50.000 the information makes all the difference
00:08:52.240 again because of consistency and
00:08:53.560 accountability so if you have the
00:08:54.800 opportunity to take your algorithms
00:08:56.360 class at University you need to do that
00:08:58.000 as soon as possible now the second
00:08:59.480 second technique I used to create
00:09:00.839 external accountability wasn't any kind
00:09:02.920 of course you don't need to be a student
00:09:04.480 at any University no boot camps no paid
00:09:07.000 resources whatsoever and the secret is
00:09:09.160 to start a leak code Club a leak code
00:09:10.959 Club is an informal organization where
00:09:12.760 you meet with a few of your friends two
00:09:14.279 to three times a week and solve three to
00:09:16.320 five leak code problems together and
00:09:18.279 this is one of the greatest hacks I've
00:09:20.279 ever discovered and truly changed the
00:09:22.079 game for me you must do this if you want
00:09:23.880 to master data structures and algorithms
00:09:25.600 in just 8 weeks but it's not what you
00:09:27.480 think you probably think that the leak
00:09:29.040 code Club was valuable because I had fun
00:09:30.959 with my friends or that other people
00:09:33.000 involved made that accountability and
00:09:34.800 forced me to stay consistent sure both
00:09:36.920 of those things are things that did help
00:09:38.519 but it's not the main thing that
00:09:39.880 actually changed the game the real
00:09:41.560 aspect of the leak code club that made
00:09:43.000 all the difference was the fact that I
00:09:44.640 was competing with my friends to see who
00:09:46.399 could get better at Le code and this is
00:09:48.040 something no one talks about nowadays
00:09:49.640 everybody talks about how competition is
00:09:51.200 bad competition is evil it's toxic you
00:09:53.360 shouldn't compete with your friends but
00:09:54.680 it's similar to any kind of sport if you
00:09:56.440 leverage competition in a healthy way it
00:09:58.680 10 acces your motivation to actually get
00:09:59.680 good at this thing listen there were
00:10:01.880 multiple times where my friend finished
00:10:03.440 the medium problem far before me and it
00:10:05.480 was crushing to lose to him I st up
00:10:07.200 would go home study for an extra 1 to
00:10:09.160 two hours because I wanted to come back
00:10:10.640 2 days later and destroy him at that
00:10:12.240 topic so if you're planning on locking
00:10:13.920 in and getting good at data structures
00:10:15.600 and algorithms in Just 2 months the only
00:10:18.000 way to do that is through external
00:10:19.399 accountability and the best way to
00:10:20.920 create that accountability is through
00:10:22.200 leak Cod club now just because you know
00:10:24.160 that starting a leak code Club is the
00:10:25.760 way that you create that accountability
00:10:27.440 doesn't mean it's going to work for you
00:10:28.959 frankly I've seen multiple people try to
00:10:31.680 do this and fail just because they don't
00:10:33.640 know these three things so here are
00:10:35.320 three things you have to apply when
00:10:36.959 creating your league code Club otherwise
00:10:38.600 it's going to crash and burn and will
00:10:39.959 not help you whatsoever the first thing
00:10:41.800 is to keep it small you probably didn't
00:10:43.519 expect this nowadays everybody in high
00:10:45.399 school and college tells you every
00:10:47.200 organization you need to start has to
00:10:48.839 have 50 people you need to be the
00:10:50.519 president you need to be throwing events
00:10:52.120 fundraisers make it this Grand thing
00:10:54.560 become a president become a leader of
00:10:56.160 all these individuals now while that
00:10:57.880 might look cool it's Absol absolutely
00:10:59.680 ridiculous and here's why the goal of
00:10:61.480 the leak code Club is to benefit you and
00:10:63.680 keep you accountable you already barely
00:10:66.079 have enough time to study data
00:10:67.440 structures and algorithms anyway so why
00:10:69.240 would you start an entire industrial
00:10:70.880 complex of students who are also getting
00:10:72.440 good at leak code you want to keep it as
00:10:74.279 small as possible so how many people
00:10:75.880 should be involved in a leak code Club
00:10:77.320 ideally in my experience the best number
00:10:79.120 is roughly 3 to six people Max and those
00:10:80.760 3 to six people need to be people who
00:10:82.240 are actually committed and dedicated to
00:10:83.800 getting good not just casuals who want
00:10:85.480 to show up and hang out these are people
00:10:87.040 who should be ser iously committed to
00:10:88.600 mastering data structures and algorithms
00:10:90.160 in just 8 weeks just like you now the
00:10:91.639 second principle to creating an
00:10:92.959 effective leag code Club is that you
00:10:94.399 must come prepared with questions the
00:10:95.840 best way to do this is to actually go
00:10:97.520 through the Paro problem set together
00:10:99.200 over the two-month period but even if
00:10:100.880 you do that you need to come with three
00:10:102.440 to five questions of the pr problem set
00:10:104.680 or other problem sets ready so that you
00:10:106.880 guys can work through that together in
00:10:108.160 the 2 to three hour period the best
00:10:109.760 breakdown I've seen is two to three
00:10:111.400 medium problems and then two easys for
00:10:112.160 warming up and a note here is that
00:10:113.680 you're probably not going to actually
00:10:115.320 work through all the problems every time
00:10:116.960 that's totally fine but as long as you
00:10:118.600 work through two three medium level
00:10:120.240 problems and a couple of easys that will
00:10:121.920 keep you occupied for the 2 hours and
00:10:123.600 the goal is to finish the two mediums
00:10:125.240 and fully understand them with your
00:10:126.800 friends and the third principle about
00:10:128.400 running an effective leag code Club is
00:10:129.880 all about timing in my experience the
00:10:131.600 best way to schedule these is three
00:10:133.280 sessions a week and 2 to 3 hours for
00:10:134.960 each session again you're not going to
00:10:136.640 work through every problem you bring
00:10:137.840 which is totally fine but as long as you
00:10:139.520 work through two to three of them that's
00:10:141.200 enough to progress over time think about
00:10:142.880 it 6 to9 High Roi Le code mediums a week
00:10:144.560 that's 60 to 70 High Roi mediums over an
00:10:147.200 8we period and that's enough to get
00:10:148.880 pretty damn good at data structures and
00:10:150.560 algorithms if you study them in the
00:10:152.240 right way okay you have a leak code Club
00:10:153.920 you have that external accountability
00:10:155.600 you know you need to practice problems
00:10:156.280 and you know which problems to practice
00:10:157.960 but even at this point people still miss
00:10:159.640 out on this one aspect of your practice
00:10:161.320 that makes all the difference let's
00:10:162.800 bring it back to the gym analogy you can
00:10:164.480 show up to the gym multiple times a week
00:10:166.120 you can show up with your friends you
00:10:167.800 can be doing the right exercises with
00:10:169.440 good technique and form and still see
00:00:00.000 little to no progress in 2 months if you
00:00:00.000 make this one mistake Nothing Else
00:00:00.000 Matters and that mistake is not trading
00:00:00.000 hard enough not pushing yourself to
00:00:00.000 failure so how does this apply to data
00:00:00.000 structures and algorithms well to
00:00:00.000 understand that I need to teach you the
00:00:00.000 under the hood technique imagine you're
00:00:00.000 trying to understand how to build and
00:00:00.000 fix cars you open the hood and glance at
00:00:00.000 how everything works and tell yourself
00:00:00.000 hey I understand this I get it I see how
00:00:00.000 everything fits together cool do you
00:00:00.000 think you'd be able to fix a car engine
00:00:00.000 if something goes wrong no way because
00:00:00.000 you literally glance through everything
00:00:00.000 and fools yourself into thinking you
00:00:00.000 understand how it works that is the
00:00:00.000 problem with so many people they study
00:00:00.000 consistently they study the right topics
00:00:00.000 but they simply don't push hard enough
00:00:00.000 to understand everything to the depth
00:00:00.000 that you need to you can't just glance
00:00:00.000 through an algorithm or data structure
00:00:00.000 and convince yourself you actually
00:00:00.000 understand it because you don't you
00:00:00.000 won't be able to replicate it in a real
00:00:00.000 coding interview you must deeply study
00:00:00.000 every concept you encounter until you
00:00:00.000 fully understand it through and through
00:00:00.000 b didn't you just say we shouldn't learn
00:00:00.000 data structures and algorithms instead
00:00:00.000 just do tons of practice of course
00:00:00.000 remember how I said that you should
00:00:00.000 focus on practice rather than learning
00:00:00.000 sure but that doesn't mean that learning
00:00:00.000 is useless learning is important after
00:00:00.000 you do the practice see even if you do
00:00:00.000 tons of practice you're probably not
00:00:00.000 going deep enough you don't understand
00:00:00.000 why the time and space complexity is the
00:00:00.000 way it is you just know what to say
00:00:00.000 you've just memorize the aspects of the
00:00:00.000 data structure algorithm you don't get
00:00:00.000 why everything fits together the way it
00:00:00.000 does for example a lot of people have
00:00:00.000 just memorized how to do depth for
00:00:00.000 search and breath for search and how to
00:00:00.000 use a stack and a q but they don't
00:00:00.000 understand what characteristics about
00:00:00.000 stacks and q's make it work for depth
00:00:00.000 research and breath research so how do
00:00:00.000 you make sure you fully understand every
00:00:00.000 data structure and algorithm you study
00:00:00.000 you need to use the five wise system the
00:00:00.000 five wise is a system that Toyota
00:00:00.000 developed in the 20th century instead of
00:00:00.000 just fixing immediate problems that come
00:00:00.000 up in the supply chain they keep asking
00:00:00.000 themselves why is this happening why is
00:00:00.000 that happening why is this happening by
00:00:00.000 asking yourself why multiple times you
00:00:00.000 uncover the root issue which is way
00:00:00.000 better longterm to fix that rather than
00:00:00.000 put a Band-Aid over the issue currently
00:00:00.000 so how do we apply this to leak code
00:00:00.000 problems let's say you're solving a leak
00:00:00.000 code problem and you need need to sort
00:00:00.000 it but you realize that sorting takes
00:00:00.000 too long because it's an N log end time
00:00:00.000 complexity if that happens you need to
00:00:00.000 ask yourself why is sorting n log end
00:00:00.000 what underlying algorithm takes n log
00:00:00.000 and time complexity to sort correctly
00:00:00.000 how does that underlying algorithm work
00:00:00.000 who came up with that underlying
00:00:00.000 algorithm you want to keep going down
00:00:00.000 multiple levels to make sure you fully
00:00:00.000 understand it before moving on if you
00:00:00.000 use the five wise technique to
00:00:00.000 understand data structures and
00:00:00.000 algorithms over the 8 weeks you will
00:00:00.000 walk away with a far greater
00:00:00.000 understanding that you'll be able to
00:00:00.000 replicate in an actual coding interview
00:00:00.000 all right right even if you know how to
00:00:00.000 get amazing at data structures and
00:00:00.000 algorithms in 8 weeks if you can't get
00:00:00.000 any interviews then there's no point
00:00:00.000 whatsoever so watch this video right
00:00:00.000 here if you want to learn how to make an
00:00:00.000 amazing resume that gets tons and tons
00:00:00.000 of interviews so you can actually apply
00:00:00.000 your DSA skills thank you guys for
00:00:00.000 watching and I'll see you in the next

            Computer science students, new graduates, and bootcamp graduates want to land your dream software engineering job or internship? 
            I'm Aman Manazir, a career coach and software engineer. I interned at companies like Amazon, Shopify, and HP in college, 
            and the day I graduated I landed a $168,000 job at a top tech company. In this video, I'm going to share with you 
            exactly how I mastered data structures and algorithms in just 8 weeks, and how you can do the same.
            
            The key is having a systematic approach. First, you need to understand the fundamentals. Start with basic data structures 
            like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Then move on to more complex ones like trees, graphs, and hash tables. 
            For algorithms, begin with sorting and searching, then progress to dynamic programming and graph algorithms.
            
            Practice is crucial. Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. Start with easy problems and gradually 
            increase difficulty. Focus on understanding the patterns and techniques rather than memorizing solutions.

            this video will provide you with practical strategies and actionable steps to achieve your goals.
            
            The first step is to clearly define what you want to learn. Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals. 
            Break down complex skills into smaller, manageable components. This makes the learning process less overwhelming and more achievable.
            
            Next, create a structured learning plan. Allocate dedicated time each day for practice and study. Consistency is key to mastery. 
            Use various learning resources like books, online courses, videos, and hands-on projects to reinforce your understanding.
